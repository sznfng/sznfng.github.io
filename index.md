I am a syntactician, working mainly on nominal licensing and, specially, on cross-clausal A-dependencies, with a focus on phenomena that challenge common assumptions about the degree of permeability of finite and nonfinite clauses. The A-dependency that my most recent research targets is obligatory control. My Google Scholar profile can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2IBXsDsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

During the 2022/23 academic year, I was a lecturer in syntax at [Yale University](https://ling.yale.edu/). During the Fall semester of 2021, I was a lecturer in linguistics at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sllf/linguistics/). I have taught syntax introductory courses and seminars at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. I have also taught introductory semantics and morphology courses.

I have a PhD degree from [MIT](https://linguistics.mit.edu/) (2021), as well as a bachelor's (2012) and a master's (2015) degree from [Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo](https://linguistica.fflch.usp.br/).
