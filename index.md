During the 2022/23 academic year, I am working as a lecturer at [Yale](https://ling.yale.edu/). I am currently teaching a freshman seminar (Linguistics in the real world) and Syntax II.

During the Fall semester of 2021, I was a lecturer in linguistics at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sllf/linguistics/). I taught introductory syntax and semantics courses at both BA and MA levels.

I have a PhD degree from [MIT](https://linguistics.mit.edu/), as well as a bachelor's and a master's degree from [Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo](https://linguistica.fflch.usp.br/).
