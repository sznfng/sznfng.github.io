I am a syntactician, working mainly on nominal licensing and on cross-clausal A-dependencies, with a focus on phenomena that challenge common assumptions about the degree of permeability of finite and nonfinite clauses. My most recent research concerns obligatory control, specially as it regards overt realizations of PRO.

During the 2022/23 academic year, I was a lecturer in syntax at [Yale University](https://ling.yale.edu/). During the Fall semester of 2021, I was a lecturer in linguistics at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sllf/linguistics/). I have taught syntax introductory courses and seminars at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. I have also taught introductory semantics and morphology courses.

I have a PhD degree from [MIT](https://linguistics.mit.edu/) (2021), as well as a bachelor's (2012) and a master's (2015) degree from [Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo](https://linguistica.fflch.usp.br/).
