I am a syntactician. I am currently unaffiliated. During the Fall semester of 2021, I was a lecturer in linguistics at Queen Mary University of London. I taught introductory syntax and semantics courses at both BA and MA levels.

I have a PhD degree from MIT, as well as bachelor's and master's degrees from Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo.

You can find my CV [here](https://sznfng.github.io/CV_sfong.pdf).

Pronouns: *she/her*; *ela/dela*.
