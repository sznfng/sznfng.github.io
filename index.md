During the 2022/23 academic year, I am working as a lecturer at [Yale University](https://ling.yale.edu/).

During the Fall semester of 2021, I was a lecturer in linguistics at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sllf/linguistics/). I taught introductory syntax and semantics courses at both BA and MA levels.

I have a PhD degree from [MIT](https://linguistics.mit.edu/), as well as a bachelor's and a master's degree from [Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo](https://linguistica.fflch.usp.br/).

My research focuses on cross-clausal A-dependencies, with a focus on phenomena that challenge common assumptions about the degree of permeability of finite and nonfinite clauses.

Pronouns: *she/ela*
