I am a syntactician. I am currently unaffiliated. During the Fall semester of 2021, I was a lecturer in linguistics at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sllf/linguistics/). I taught introductory syntax and semantics courses at both BA and MA levels.

I have a PhD degree from [MIT](https://linguistics.mit.edu/), as well as a bachelor's and a master's degree from [Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo](https://linguistica.fflch.usp.br/).

My CV is available [here](https://sznfng.github.io/CV_sfong.pdf).
