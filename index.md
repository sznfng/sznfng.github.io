I am an assistant professor at the Department of Linguistics at Memorial University of Newfoundland. My research spans different topics in syntactic theory, focusing on dependencies across clauses and nominal licensing. I received a PhD degree from [MIT](https://linguistics.mit.edu/) and a M.A. degree from [Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo](https://linguistica.fflch.usp.br/). Before MUN, I served as a lecture at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sllf/linguistics/) and at [Yale](https://ling.yale.edu/).
