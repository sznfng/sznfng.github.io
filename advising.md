title: Advising
---

I have been fortunate to work with students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. I mainly advise students working on different topics of syntax and morphosyntax. Some of the topics I have advised on include:

+ Algonguian direct vs. inverse marking in monoclausal sentences and also across a finite clause (a.k.a. "Long Distance Agreement")
+ Other types of cross-clausal dependencies
+ Agreement vs. resumption

Some of the languages or language families I have advised on include: Akan, Algonquian, ASL (American Sign Language), English, Yorùbá.
